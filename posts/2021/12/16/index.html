  <p><p>Writing is hard, like really hard. And that is why I decided I need to start practicing again. After all, some of the best skills in life are hard to improve, yet incredibly gratifying.</p>
<p>And the only way to get better at something is to practice it, right?</p>
<h2 id="of-clouds-and-developers">Of Clouds And Developers</h2>
<p>After spending about a dozen years building infrastructure and applications in AWS, I&rsquo;ve had to recently take a hiatus. Not a hiatus from building and developing, but from AWS. I got a new job back in September, and let&rsquo;s say things have been a bit different.</p>
<p>The company I work for is building out a multi-cloud strategy, with the primary pillar being Azure. I have no experience with Azure. Let&rsquo;s just say, the last few months have been a huge learning experience.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest for a moment. Humbling myself, starting over, and learning a totally new cloud platform &ndash; really wasn&rsquo;t part of my plan at this point in my career.</p>
<h2 id="discomfort-precedes-growth">Discomfort Precedes Growth</h2>
<p>While it&rsquo;s been uncomfortable at times learning all the terminologies and idiosyncrasies of a new platform, the growth has been really welcome.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope writing brings the same kind of gratification.</p>
