<p>A few important things are happening right now as a direct consequence of the ongoing government shutdown. And the longer the shutdown continues, the more damage will accumulate. Some damage may end up being irreversible by the time a spending bill is passed, the government is reopened, and agencies begin staffing up again.</p>
<p>How many staff will ultimately return? And how many have lost faith in government? How many furloughed employees have been &ldquo;interviewed&rdquo; unwittingly by foreign agents, while looking for temporary work? It&rsquo;s not as far fetched as it seems.</p>

<h1 id="website-rot">Website Rot</h1>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/government-shutdown-tls-certificates-not-renewed-many-websites-are-down/">more than 80 TLS certificates have expired</a>. Some websites are completely inaccessible. Websites with expired certificates that <em>also</em> have misconfigured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HSTS</a> are still available, however, browsers are now displaying a warning about the content of the site. All data transmission between client and server is unencrypted and susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">MITM attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Websites are not actively being managed, with many of the support staff furloughed. If a compromise happens, it will go undetected while the attackers entrench, spread, and exfiltrate sensitive data.</p>
<h1 id="departments-shuttered">Departments Shuttered</h1>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology is reduced to 49 from roughly 3,000 employees.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has an estimated 43% of employees furloughed &ndash; over 1,500 staff.</p>
<p>These furloughs have very real short term and long term security consequences.</p>
