<p>I&rsquo;ve had the same personal email address for a long time now. So it doesn&rsquo;t come as much of a surprise that there were a list of results when searching for it on Have I Been Pwnd? The size of the list, <em>at ten hacks</em>, was a little surprising.</p>

<p>Equally surprising, my work email had been included in hacks as well. This, despite being registered with far fewer accounts and all with good reputations.</p>

<p>All of this emphasizes the need for <a href="https://danmunro.com/posts/the-password-is-dead/">good password hygiene</a>, including using strong, unique passwords for every account.</p>
