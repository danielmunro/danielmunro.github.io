  <h1>Laid Off Amid Corona Virus Slowdown</h1>
  <aside></aside>
  <p><p>As I write this, it is Thursday evening, about 8:30, April 2nd, and I think the shock has finally started to wear off.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, two days ago, I found out I was laid off from my job of six years, effective immediately. I&rsquo;m not going to go into details about the specifics of the layoff, that wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate for a number of reasons. But most importantly my family and I are okay, and we are figuring out our next big adventure already.</p>
<p>But there are personal details I do want to share about what happened, both for posterity, but also to help anyone else in a similar position &ndash; feeling the fallout of this most recent economic slowdown.</p>
<p>What I can share about the situation: no one is happy. We all believe very strongly in the mission of the company. The feeling is hard to describe, but it&rsquo;s almost like losing a good friendship due to unforeseen circumstances. The loss was personal in the sense that we all knew each other very well and had built a culture we were all proud of, that reflected all of us.</p>
<p>I am extremely proud of the work we did, and the choices we made. I wasn&rsquo;t always right, but I was able to provide sound reasoning and learn from my mistakes. I worked with incredibly smart, talented, and well rounded colleagues, for whom I maintain the utmost respect.</p>
<p>In my tenure, the company grew from three employees fully distributed, to a little over one hundred full time employees across two offices. I helped interview and hire almost every engineer and a few other senior positions. The tech stack changed completely once, and there were almost too many learning opportunities to list in one article. I saw a promotion, from Lead Software Engineer to Information Security Manager.</p>
